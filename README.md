# GraphLang

An experimental, blazing fast purely functional Graph Reduction Virtual Machine written in C.

## Roadmap & Upcoming Features

- [ ] Move Environments to the GC Heap (AST Nodes for true Closures)
- [ ] Implement Cheney's Copying GC (O(1) Allocation & Zero-pause Sweeps)
- [ ] Implement the Accumulator Pattern (Tail Recursion)
- [ ] Add Tail Call Optimization (TCO) with a Trampoline
- [ ] Support Custom Datatypes (Plugin-defined ADTs & Userdata)
- [ ] Build IO Monads for Side Effects
- [ ] Create a Frontend Lexer & Parser

GraphLang is a minimal, fast, integer-only programming language. At its core, it is an expression evaluator built entirely on a **strict binary tree**, with built-in support for variables, functions, and conditionals.

## Syntax Design

GraphLang uses a clean, modern LL(1) syntax. The parser distinguishes between variables and functions dynamically by using a single token of lookahead:

- **Variable Definition:** `def x = 10`
- **Function Definition:** `def add(a, b) = a + b`
- **Variable Usage:** `x + 5` (Evaluates to 15)
- **Function Call:** `add(x, 5)`
- **Comments:** Any text following a single quote `'` is ignored by the lexer.

Because function calls are always followed by parentheses or arguments, the parser can easily differentiate them from variables.

## Operational Rules

- **Execution:** GraphLang evaluates source code by reading `.gl` files from top to bottom.
- **Truthiness:** There is no boolean type. `1` is True and `0` is False. Comparison operators naturally evaluate to `0` or `1`.
- **Variables:** Variables are completely mutable. Redefining a variable simply overwrites its previous entry in the hashtable.
- **Errors & Result Types:** Functions do not segfault on expected errors (like division by zero). Instead, they return the integer `0` tagged with a custom error flag. If a user tries to use an error-flagged node in a math operation without checking it first, the program safely aborts (Strict Error Propagation). Users handle these errors using a built-in `catch_flag` macro which clears the flag and executes a branch.

## Architecture & Evaluation

### The Microkernel Architecture
GraphLang is designed as an extensible **Microkernel Interpreter**. The core VM is completely agnostic to data types or operations. It simply provides:
1. A Memory Allocator and Garbage Collector.
2. A generic AST `Node` structure.
3. A `PluginAPI` that allows dynamic shared libraries (`.so` files) to register custom evaluation rules.

Built-in operations (like math) are loaded at runtime via the `CoreMath.so` plugin. This means users can completely redefine the semantics of the language by swapping out plugins.

### Strict Binary Tree
Everything in GraphLang is a strict binary tree. Function calls take exactly two arguments (mapped directly to the `left` and `right` AST node pointers), and arbitrary argument lists are constructed using standard Cons cells (`LIST` nodes).

### Lexical Scoping & Environments
Instead of relying on a global hashtable or tree rewriting (which is slow and destroys function blueprints), GraphLang evaluates variables using **Lexical Scoping**. 
When a user-defined function is called, the VM creates a new `LocalEnv` binding on the C stack (which will soon be moved to the GC heap to support true Closures) and links it to the parent environment.

### Strict Evaluation (Call-by-Value)
GraphLang uses strict **Call-by-Value** evaluation. Arguments passed to functions are fully evaluated in the caller's environment before being bound to the new scope. This prevents infinite loops (the Funarg problem) and ensures predictable execution speed.

### Memory Management (Mark-and-Sweep GC)
Because the AST creates many intermediate nodes during evaluation, GraphLang manages memory using a custom **Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector**. 
During evaluation, the VM pushes temporary C-stack variables to the GC's "Shadow Stack" (`pushRoot`) to protect them from being swept. The GC walks all active roots, marks reachable nodes, and reclaims dead nodes safely. (A Cheney Copying GC is planned for future optimization).

## Building & Running

A `Makefile` is provided for standard compilation.

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Build and execute
./run.sh
```
